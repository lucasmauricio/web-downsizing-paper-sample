Abstract: 
This paper describes a Web architecture with processing on the client-side in contrast
to the widely used Web architecture that focuses on processing on the server-side.
The growth in use of processingment on the client is similar to the downsizing of
the computing platform occurred from the 1970s in which part of the computing
utilities migrated from mainframe to personal computers. Held a brief discussion
subsidiary on the Web architecture, HTTP, URI, REST, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
and Ajax as the basis for the presentation of this architecture with the processing
on client. In addition to its description, its structure, its operation and its positive
and negative points are raised, not so exhausted in this work. Finally, are presented
some examples of building software in this architecture.

Key-words: 
Client-side web processing. Downsizing. REST. HTML5. Ajax. JavaScript. Web platform. Client-server architecture.
